# Mikoto Muon

Muon is the experimental next-gen Mikoto backend, rewritten in Rust.

The components of Muon project include:

- **Mikoto Muon**, the new backend server.
- **Hyperschema 2.0**, the rewrite of Hyperschema in Rust.
- **Muonic**, a graph-based ORM on Postgres.

This repository is developed outside the main Mikoto monorepo, and this repository will be archived and merged into the main monorepo once it's ready.
